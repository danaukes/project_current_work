# What are the major goals of the project?

This project envisions a unified and automated pipeline for understanding and leveraging compliant behavior in tuned dynamical systems that are affordable and easily prototyped. Our goal is to make it possible for a non-expert to design and prototype a two hundred dollar robot in under two hours.

We propose four main research objectives to accomplish this goal:

1.  Modeling and representation of compliant materials
2.  Leveraging compliance-enabled phenomena,
3.  Simulation-based co-optimization of design and control of dynamical systems
4.  Verifying the pipeline at element, subsystem, and system levels.

We believe this will be accomplished through a focused set of activities:

1.  Simplifying the process of modeling, prototyping, testing, and controlling robots
2.  Focusing on the use of affordable material systems within robot design
3.  Focusing on accessible, rapid-prototyping-based fabrication strategies that promote iteration and keep cost low
4.  Factoring in, fully utilizing, and optimizing systems in full consideration of the innate compliance of lower-cost material systems, for use in high-performance applications.

## Major Activities

Our focus in Y2 has been along the following major activities, all surrounding the design of compliant, legged, laminate systems:

1.  The ideation, design, and prototyping of legged laminate systems that permit us to encode desired, nonlinear spring stiffness profiles into laminate structures, combined with linkage-based parallel mechanisms.
2.  Developing models of these systems based on the "template" and "anchor" approaches for representing legs. (Templates: simple spring-mass-damper "pogo-stick" models. Anchors: more realistic kinematic and dynamic representations of the materials and geometry involved in the actual leg design)
3.  Developing a design and testing pipeline for 1) measuring ground reaction forces and other interactions, 2) tracking leg motion given prescribed input actuation signals, and 3) measuring subsystem and system stiffness.

These activities are intended to permit the rapid development, modeling, prototyping, and testing of families of compliant legged systems whose stiffness can be tuned on demand as a function of laminate geometry and material selection while maintaining a common design template.

A second set of activities \-- recently begun \-- includes the ideation, prototyping, and initial testing of hierarchical compliant feet, for interaction with a variety of ground substrates, including hard ground, soil, and granular media. Current work has looked at the role surface area and compliance play in the foot's ability to generate tangential forces under prescribed normal loads.

## Specific Objectives

The following are the objectives driving the above activities:

1.  Understanding the mechanisms by which simple changes in the kinematics or geometry of laminate leg systems can be tuned in order to change the linearity of the leg stiffness profile.
2.  Understanding whether nonlinear leg compliance plays a role in improving performance across a range of activities, with an initial focus on jumping. Our goal is to proceed to study nonlinear compliance's role in landing, walking, running, and other terrestrial gaits and activities.
3.  Understanding the role compliance, shape, area, and other design factors play in the interactions with rigid, soft, and granular models for ground
4.  Understanding whether hierarchical, multi-material or "multiple-compliance" laminate structures embedded within robotic feet can play a role in improving locomotion performance 1) across a range of ground models and properties, and 2) across different types of interactions/activities with the ground, such as digging.

## Significant results

We are wrapping up a significant set of design, data collection, and analysis activities that will culminate in our first journal paper submission, to be submitted this month. Current results are attached in supplemental documentation.

## Key outcomes or Other achievements

This work has resulted in a family of jumping robotic leg designs whose stiffness profiles are highly tunable and nonlinear. Legs within this family can be rapidly prototyped (from CAD to prototype in \~ X hours), permitting the experimental characterization and validation of both "template"-based and "anchor"-based models throughout a large design space. These legs have been studied from the perspective of understanding how linearity in compliance can play a role in expanding jumping capabilities, especially as we begin to consider the needs of competing activities such as landing, walking, and running, which may dictate different design goals that require trade-offs. The legs have been prototyped, experimentally characterized in a series of dynamic jumping tests, and compared against model-based predictions of their motion.

We have also developed a new set of script-based tools that permit the rapid translation of leg designs from Autodesk Fusion 360 to be exported to a layer-based representation that can be used to compute the manufacturing files required for fabrication.

Describe how findings, results, techniques that were developed or extended, or other products from the project made an impact or are likely to make an impact on the base of knowledge, theory, and research and/or pedagogical methods in the principal disciplinary field(s) of the project.

Though many jumping robots have been previously reported, many of these devices represent highly-optimized expert-driven designs focused solely on jumping, wherein all the important decisions are encoded a priori into the mechanical structure and static, pre-selected, off-the-shelf parts. Few designs focus on cost-conscious fabrication approaches, consider the flexibility of their constituent building materials, or consider how/whether that built-in compliance can be tuned so as to improve performance of an activity, let alone across multiple robotic tasks. Our approach aims to holistically consider these aspects using a fabrication strategy that permits a high degree of tunability during design to balance the needs of potentially competing performance targets across multiple desired tasks or in a variety of situations or environments.
